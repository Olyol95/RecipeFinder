<h1>Ever forgotten the recipe for an item?</h1>

Now, with Recipe Finder, you can find the recipe of an item with as little effort as a single command!

<h2>Current Features:</h2>

<ul>
<li><font face="Courier New">/recipe <item name></font> will display the recipes for all items that match the given item name.</li>
<li><font face="Courier New">/recipe</font> on its own will display the recipes of the item in your hand.</li>
<li>Multiple recipes will be scrolled through one by one.</li>
<li>Clicking an item in a recipe will display the recipes of said item.</li>
<li>Smelting recipes are also supported.</li>
<li>Names are matched in such a way that commands such as ##/recipe chestplate## will display the recipes for all types of chestplate.</li>
<li>The plugin hooks into the Bukkit/Spigot API, and hence is lightweight, fast and scalable.</li>
<li>Any recipe registered on the server through the API should be visible to the plugin.</li>
<li>Threading ensures that multiple users can access the recipe list simultaneously.</li>
<li>Recipes for coloured wool and dyes also supported!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Permissions:</h2>

<ul>
<li><font face="Courier New">recipe.lookup</font>: gives access to <font face="Courier New">/recipe</font>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features to hopefully be implemented in the future:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Multi - language support for item lookup.</li>
<li>Potion recipes.</li>
<li>Firework recipes.</li>
</ul>
